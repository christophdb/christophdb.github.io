## Christoph Dyllick-Brenzinger

I’m a Mannheim Uni economics grad who started as a consultant at Detecon (Deutsche Telekom’s tech arm). Promoted twice in four years, I became their youngest-ever Senior Consultant. Working with major corporations sparked my passion for process automation and IT—I thrive at the intersection of developers and management.

In 2014, I co-founded three companies with my brother Ralf. Today, we’re the global distributors of [Seafile](https://seafile.com) (sync-and-share) and [SeaTable](https://seatable.com) (no-code platform). Self-taught in IT, I code in PHP, Python, React, and Go, and I’m all about lean deployments with Docker, Kubernetes, and n8n for automations.

This blog is my space to share insights, hacks, and discoveries in automation, optimization, and Linux. Dive in—you might just find the spark for your next big challenge.

## Sharing knowledge

I’m passionate about sharing what I’ve learned and inspiring others. That’s why I’m excited to step into the role of a speaker — whether at conferences, meetups, or workshops. Let’s connect, collaborate, and make an impact together!
